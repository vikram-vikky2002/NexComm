    <h2>🚀 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      NexComm was created to solve a real-world problem — poor internet connectivity in remote areas. We aim to provide an offline-first messaging solution
      that enables users to chat and share files over a local area network (LAN), ensuring fast, secure, and reliable communication without the internet.
